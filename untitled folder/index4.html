We have a lot of toys around the house including four dirtbikes, a jetski, and a boat.
I enjoy a lot of outdoor activities and have a lot of fun with them, as you can tell. 
Also during the winter i enjoy snow boarding whether it be on the slopes or in my
backyard. I hope that I will have time to snowboard while im up here in maine because 
i know that sugarloaf is kind of close and i love to board on that mountain. The snow 
is always so nice and fresh as well.
