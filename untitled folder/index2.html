	I played Hockey and Lacrosse in highschool, and am continuing to play in college.
I scored my first college goal last weekend against Providence College, where i tied 
the game and then we ended up winning. The picture below is right after i scored.
In my free time I like to hang out with friends and play 2K and NHL. I also hanging 
out with friends too and doing anything with them. I have a friend that may attend 
school here next year from my high school.
