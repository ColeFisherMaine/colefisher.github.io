I love where i am at right now. I love it here at UMaine. I think that i chose the
right school to attend to. I could however go with out the cold. I still need to get a 
good winter jacket that will keep me warm while walking to classes everyday. I want 
to get a jacket with a fur hood on it. I am having a blast here and its only getting 
started.
