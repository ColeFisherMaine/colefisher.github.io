	<b>I am Cole Fisher. 
	</b>	
</h1>

<h2>I am a student at The University of Maine.</h2>
My major i am studying for is a finance degree. I am from Medway, Massachusetts 
which is about 20 minutes south of boston. I went to Medway Public Highschool. 
I had a lot of fun there and enjoyed my time while receiving a good education.
This is a picture of my friend matt and I, he goes to UMaine as well. He was best
friends with my brother during high school and that is how we had both become friends.
He is a very funny guy and is very fun to be around.
